# BlackStone

Blackstone is Minecraft Survival server written in Node.js as an exercise. It's architecture is far from optimal.

# Features

Right now the server can be pinged from server selection screen, and user can authenticate (but chunks cannot be sent yet, so no actual game).

# Why?

Just for fun. I want to try and create functioning server that will serve as playground for Mob AI testing. That's all.

# Thanks

First, thanks for this awesome game, [Notch](http://twitter.com/notch)!
